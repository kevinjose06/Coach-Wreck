# Coach Wreck ðŸŽ¯

## Basic Details  
**Team Name:** The Last Brain-Cell  
**Team Members**  
- **Team Lead:** Kevin Jose â€“ RIT Pampady  

## Project Description  
Coach Wreck is your ultimate anti-motivation companion. Ask for advice, and it roasts you instead. It's not here to help â€” it's here to humble you. Built to demolish your confidence, one sarcastic reply at a time.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Tired of being motivated and supported all the time? Fed up with chatbots that *actually* try to help you improve your life?

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
Coach Wreck gives you brutal, hilarious, and devastating roasts instead of encouragement. You ask a serious question, it delivers a sass-filled takedown. Think of it as your personal AI frenemy.
